1. Core Data Structures & Algorithms:

Lists: Creating, manipulating, and iterating over lists. List comprehensions.
Dictionaries: Key-value pairs, efficient lookups, and dictionary methods.
Sets: Membership testing, set operations (union, intersection, difference).
Tuples: Immutable sequences, efficient for storing and accessing data.
Basic Algorithms: Searching (linear and binary), sorting (bubble, insertion, selection).
2. Control Flow & Logic:

Conditional Statements: if, elif, else for decision-making.
Loops: for and while loops for iteration.
Functions: Defining, calling, and using arguments and return values.
3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals:

Classes: Creating classes and objects, attributes, and methods.
Inheritance: Understanding parent-child relationships between classes.
Encapsulation: Data hiding and information protection.
Polymorphism: Overriding methods and achieving different behaviors.
4. Working with Files & Data:

File Handling: Opening, reading, writing, and closing files.
Working with CSV/JSON: Reading and writing data in common file formats.
Data Structures (advanced): Stacks, Queues, Trees (basic understanding).
5. Essential Libraries:

math: Mathematical functions (e.g., sqrt, sin, cos).
random: Generating random numbers.
datetime: Working with dates and times.
